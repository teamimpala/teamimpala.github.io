	  <!-- You may introduce some background information about your project, including client's name, their business, and the problem to be solved.<br> -->
	  Our client is Chris Piwinski, co-founder of LEVEL Baseball. Chris is a product manager at Twilio where he works on programmable messaging. He 
	  was also the captain of the Yale Bulldogs baseball team in 2012-2013.

  <p>
    Level is a baseball/softball-oriented platform that seeks to provide athletes and programs a way to capture, organize, and access their best moments.

	  <!--Describe the scope of your project.<br>
	  Which parts of the business problem will be addressed? <br> 
	  What are the project goals? <br> -->
    The aim of our project is to create an automated video library by combining app-based score keeping with a web-based video platform. 
    Currently, LEVEL manually reviews video footage and delivers individual clips to its users. This process currently has no structured score keeping and no timestamps. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to increase its user base, LEVEL needs to improve scalability and automate its current workflow. 
    To do this, we will create a mobile app that allows users to record, synchronize, and keep score of video footage of a baseball game with moments of interest to the user.

	<h3><B>Solution</h3></B>
</div>
<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	<!-- Give a high-level overview of the proposed solution. -->
 In order to address the issue of LEVEL manually reviewing footage, our solution is to combine score keeping and timestamp creation into one mobile application. 
 This will improve scalability by removing the bottleneck that is manually reviewing footage by automating the process.
 This also allows users to score keep while also keeping track of timestamps of events that are of most interest to them.

	<h3><B>Highlights</h3></B>
</div>
  <p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
  <!--	What is special about your project?<br> 
	  You may compare your proposed solution with existing ones, and elaborate on why it is innovative, in which aspects.<br>-->
	  Our project aims to differentiate itself from score keeping apps entirely. 
    Rather than simply keeping track of scores during a game, we will be supplementing that information with video highlights from players that are synchronized with timestamps. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Since this is a large project and LEVEL is already working with different contractors, we will be developing the mobile application while another group builds the database that we will be pulling information from and sending information to. 
  </p>

<div id="title">
  <h3><B>Implementation</h3></B>
</div>
  <p>
    In this project, we used the Dart programming language to code the LEVEL Mobile Application. We followed the SCRUM process to schedule our sprints and have 
    testable products ready for our client. Our team members communicated and helped one another when an issue occurred during this our scheduled sprints.
  </p>
  <p>
    We performed manual testing on Android and iPhone simulators/mobile devices to verify that the application
    works properly.
  </p>

<div id="title">
  <h3><B>Lessons Learned</h3></B>
</div>
  <p>
    Most of our team members were unfamiliar with working on a large scale mobile application
    with other members, so we learned a lot of useful technologies and soft skills throughout this project:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Version control and project management using Gitlab</li>
    <li>Time management to balance the project work we had to accomplish with our two-week sprints</li>
    <li>Communication between our team and our client helped us make sure the project was to 
      the client's satisfaction</li>
    <li>Learning a new programming language - Dart</li>
    <li>Learning a new framework - Flutter</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><B>Acknowledgement</h3></B>
</div>
  <p>
    We want to thank our client, Chris Piwinski, who has been patient with us throughout our development
    process and understanding of the requirements we had to accomplish for our Senior Project. We are also
    grateful for this hands-on, learning experience developing a mobile application.
