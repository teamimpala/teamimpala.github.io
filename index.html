	<!--Describe the scope of your project.<br>
	Which parts of the business problem will be addressed? <br> 
	What are the project goals? <br> -->
 The aim of our project is to create an automated video library by combining app-based score keeping with a web-based video platform. Currently, LEVEL manually reviews video footage and delivers individual clips to its users. This process currently has no structured score keeping and no timestamps. In order to increase its user base, LEVEL needs to improve scalability and automate its current workflow. To do this, we will create a mobile app that allows users to record, synchronize, and keep score of video footage of a baseball game with moments of interest to the user.

	<h3><B>Proposed Solution</h3></B>
</div>



<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
	<!-- Give a high-level overview of the proposed solution. -->
 In order to address the issue of LEVEL manually reviewing footage, our solution is to combine score keeping and timestamp creation into one mobile application. This will improve scalability by removing the bottleneck that is manually reviewing footage by automating the process. This also allows users to score keep while also keeping track of timestamps of events that are of most interest to them.

	<h3><B>Highlights</h3></B>
</div>


<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
<!--	What is special about your project?<br> 
	You may compare your proposed solution with existing ones, and elaborate on why it is innovative, in which aspects.<br>-->
	Our project aims to differentiate itself from score keeping apps entirely. Rather than simply keeping track of scores during a game, we will be supplementing that information with video highlights from players that are synchronized with timestamps. Since this is a large project and LEVEL is already working with different contractors, we will be developing the mobile application while another group builds the database that we will be pulling information from and sending information to.
